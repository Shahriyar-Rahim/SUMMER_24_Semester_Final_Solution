## Project Overview
Provide a short paragraph describing:
- the problem the project solves,
- the main approach or algorithm used,
- any important constraints or assumptions.

Example:
This solution implements X to solve Y. It includes data processing, core algorithm implementation, and a small CLI/web front-end for demonstration.

(Replace this block with a precise description of your assignment and approach.)

## Features
- Feature 1 — short description (e.g., data import & validation)
- Feature 2 — short description (e.g., core algorithm / model)
- Feature 3 — short description (e.g., results export / visualization)
- Tests and examples demonstrating correctness

## Prerequisites
List the platform and any required tools, for example:
- Git (to clone the repo)
- Python 3.8+ (if this is a Python project) or Node 14+ (if Node), etc.
- Optional: virtualenv / venv or Docker

Note: adjust the commands below to the language used in the repository.

## Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shahriyar-Rahim/SUMMER_24_Semester_Final_Solution.git
cd SUMMER_24_Semester_Final_Solution
```

If the project is Python-based:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS / Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows (PowerShell)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If the project is Node-based:
```bash
npm install
```

If the project uses another stack (Java, C#, etc.), update these instructions accordingly.

## Running the project

Replace the example commands below with the actual entrypoint(s) for this repository.

Python example:
```bash
python main.py           # or `python -m package.module`
```

Node example:
```bash
npm start
```

Docker example:
```bash
docker build -t summer24-solution .
docker run --rm summer24-solution
```

## Testing

Provide how to run tests and what framework is used.

Python / pytest:
```bash
pytest -q
```

Node / Jest:
```bash
npm test
```

If there are no automated tests, include instructions for manual validation or example input/output.

## Project Structure
(Adjust this tree to match the repository source layout.)

- README.md                 — this file
- requirements.txt / package.json — dependency manifest
- src/ or app/              — source code
- tests/                    — automated tests
- data/                     — sample input or dataset (if included)
- docs/                     — additional documentation, design notes
- examples/                 — example commands / sample inputs & outputs

## How to extend / Contribute
- Describe the major modules and where to add new features.
- Add coding style / linting recommendations.
- Explain how to run and add tests.
- If you accept contributions, add a CONTRIBUTING.md.

## Notes for instructors / graders
- Which files to inspect for correctness (e.g., `src/solution.py`, `notebook/analysis.ipynb`).
- How to reproduce results quickly (command or script).
- Any known limitations and assumptions you made.

Example:
- To reproduce the main result run `python evaluate.py --dataset examples/sample.csv`
- Expected output: `Final score: 0.87`
